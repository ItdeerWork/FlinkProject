The granularity to create time chunks at.
Multiple segments can be created per time chunk.
For example, with 'DAY' segmentGranularity,
the events of the same day fall into the same time chunk which can be optionally further partitioned into multiple segments based on other configurations and input size.
See Granularity for supported granularities.
